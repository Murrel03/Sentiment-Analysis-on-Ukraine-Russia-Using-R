Kaggle dataset named “RUSSIA-UKRAINE WAR TWEETS DATASET (65
DAYS)” was used in this project. It was created by a Russian named Daria Purtova
as he wanted to see the evolution of the discussion around Ukraine and Russia. So
he parsed quite a big number of tweets and hence this dataset was created. Despite
the fact that there were lots of speculations about the probable invasion in the press,
it came as a complete shock for many other Russians.
